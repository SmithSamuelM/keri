# KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)

Documentation for the KERI protocol. Mostly markdown documents about implementation details. We are just posting support and source documentation that is used to inform the IETF Internet Draft specificaiton for KERI.

Note there are *Question-and-Answer* documents available in a designated repository [WOT-terms](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms), it's the development ground of [KERISSE](kerisse.org) which contains *Concepts*, *Terms*, *Glossary* and the "Whats and Whys" around the *development environment* of the KERI Suite:

- [Q-and-A.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/docs/07_education/q-and-a.md)
- [Q-and-A-Security.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/docs/07_education/q-and-a-security.md)
- [keri-dev-env.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/docs/06_concepts/keri-dev-env.md)
- [Glossary.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/static/glossary.html)

The Search Engine at KERISSE (hourglass in the upper right corner) offers hits in all kinds of reference material and code and then guides you through the filter process in the left sidebar to reduce the number of hits to a human digestable and individually relevant set.
There's lots of references to external resources.

So from early 2023 the documentation of our repo's is more accurately available and searchable in [KERISSE](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms). We offer a commenting option in KERISSE through github issues.
