# KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)

Documentation for the KERI protocol. Mostly markdown documents about implementation details. We are just posting support and source documentation that is used to inform the IETF Internet Draft specificaiton for KERI.

Note there are *Question-and-Answer* documents available, a legacy *Glossary* and the "Whats and Whys" around the *development environment* of the KERI Suite:
- Q-and-A-Security.md
- Q-and-A.md
- keri-dev-env.md
- Glossary.md

From early 2023 the listed files are more accurately available in [KERISSE](https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms)
