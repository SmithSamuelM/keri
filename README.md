## Existing Implementations
The reference implementation for KERI is the keripy implementation. This is hosted here by the WebOfTrust project. The repository may be found here:

The keripy implementation is Apache-2.0 licensed as are all repositories in the WebOfTrust project. 

We also encourage the implementation of KERI in other languages. We are happy to host other implementations here
in the WebOfTrust project as long as they are Apache-2.0 licensed.
