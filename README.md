### Why IETF

The value statement and organizational principles of the IETF strongly resonate with KERI.
Quoting from [The Tao of IETF](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/), **emphasis added**:

>The IETF is a loosely self-organized group of people who contribute to the engineering and evolution of Internet technologies. It is the principal body engaged in the development of new Internet standard specifications. The IETF is unusual in that it exists as a collection of happenings, online and in-person, **in which individuals voluntarily participate. It has no members, and no dues;** see [RFC 3935](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3935), "A Mission Statement for the IETF", for more detail.
>
>Its mission includes the following:
>
>> + Identifying and proposing solutions to pressing operational and technical problems in the Internet  
>> + Specifying the development or usage of protocols and the near-term architecture to solve such technical problems for the Internet  
>> + Making recommendations to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) regarding the standardization of protocols and protocol usage in the Internet  
>> + Facilitating technology transfer from the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) to the wider Internet community  
>> + Providing a forum for the exchange of information within the Internet community between vendors, users, researchers, agency contractors, operators, and network managers 
>>  
>The IETF mission further states that the Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF. The IETF wants the Internet to be useful for communities that share our commitment to openness and fairness. The IETF embraces technical concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and sharing of resources because those concepts resonate with the core values of the IETF community. These concepts have little to do with the technology that's possible, and much to do with the technology that we choose to create.  

We always believed that the end state for KERI standards would be at IETF but were willing to incubate them elsewhere in advance of the formal IETF RFC standards track process if for no other reason than familiarity. We believe that there is now no longer any need for incubation. The last year has seen the keripy implementation reach beta status including support for fully functional verifiable credentials. We believe that this has sufficiently informed KERI to propose a set of IETF Internet-Draft submissions for KERI and related technology which are being pursued under the auspices of this project, [WebOfTrust](https://github.com/WebOfTrust), with associated repositories for both code and IETF Internet-Drafts. Like a phoenix from the ashes, we believe that KERI fixes the limitations of the original PKI based [Web-Of-Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). With a KERI-enabled decentralized Web-Of-Trust we truly have a path forward to achieve a truly decentralized **trust spanning layer** for the Internet; (see [Hourglass Model](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/7/237714-on-the-hourglass-model/fulltext)).

### Policy
See the documents in this repo titled [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/Keri/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/Keri/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for licensing and contributing policy. Besides the IETF licensing terms, these include the comprehensive Apache2 license for all associated intellectual property (IP) including patents. The advantage of one comprehensive license for all contributions is that there will always be alignment between all contributors and for any type of contribution. This alignment includes an **inbound=outbound** [policy](https://opensource.guide/legal/) for all related IP. We only want contributions to KERI made here in the WebOfTrust project that are licensed as free, and [nonreciprocal](https://opensource.org/node/875) open source be it software or specification.

### Education

Community members have an education/documentation effort in progress here [edu](https://keriworld.slack.com/archives/C03RB6ASVUM)'. The repo for the Web of Trust terminology and glossaries is [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms). 

Technical meetings on [KERISSE](kerisse.org) take place twice a week. Drop us a line if you're considering participation by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/issues). 
The repo for the Web of Trust terminology and glossaries is [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms). 

## Existing Implementations
The reference implementation for KERI is the keripy implementation. This is hosted here by the WebOfTrust project. The repository may be found here:  
* [keripy](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy) â€“ under development  

The keripy implementation is Apache-2.0 licensed as are all repositories in the WebOfTrust project. 

We also encourage the implementation of KERI in other languages. We are happy to host other implementations here
in the WebOfTrust project as long as they are Apache-2.0 licensed.
