- Reports
    - CESRox
    - CESR
    - KERIpy
        - In current implementation, 2 rotations required to change control authority.  
        - In new rotation rules, you can rotate to new keys that aren't in the prior next key digests.  You just need to reach the appropriate thresholds of prior next threshold and current signing threshold.  So you now only need one rotation to change control authority.
        - This change was the forcing function to require dual index codes in CESR
        - KLI usability enhancements.  Multisig Shell for creating multisig AIDs.
        - Fixed agent endpoint for challenge response.
    - KERIox
    - vLEI
        - Staging GLEIF Root AID, using staging GLEIF witness network.
        - Working on staging GLEIF External AID and GLEIF External AID this week.
    - Keep
        - Fork of repository to GLEIF-IT that now has the GLEIF branding.
        - Pending push to WoT repo to generic branding.

- Items
    - DID:KERI method implementation
        - BCGov Discussion how to make KERI more interoperable with DID infrastructure.
            - DID Resolver
                - did:keri   OOBI service endpoint tunnel
                - did:keri did doc with more features with local secured did resolver
                    - Discover from a did everything from KERI withnesses and watchers in did:doc
                    - 
            - Exchange Protoocol (DIF Presetntation)
            - How to understand ACDC
        - did:keri:<aid>:<oobi url>?seq=4&dig=<SAID>
          - essentially and end verifiable did:web URL
          - adding a query string to the end of the did allows for specifying key state
        - did:web:http://example.com/oobi/<aid>/controller
          - did:web is essentially all blind OOBIs
        - can easily rewrite any existing query message as a URL query string
    - Witness Rotation 
        - Forwarding responsibility of witnesses being rotated out.  They are required to publish up to the last event that rotated them out.
        - For lost or misbehaving witnesses, you need another mechanism to publish your key state and new witness information, like the watcher network.
        - If all your witnesses go down at the same time, you have a problem.  So your availability contraints drive your decision about how many witnesses/watchers you need.
        - Backer registrar could have a forwarding event on the ledger to track a move to another ledger.

    - Eclipse Attack Comparison KERI vs PoW
        - Primarily attacks on permissionless networks, to succeed in a double spend hack
        - Assume I have a full node on a PoW network.  When a full node gets a chain longer than the one they currently have (fork) the rule is to take the longer chain and throw away the shorter fork.
        - Take over all the neighbor nodes of the target of the attack and share a longer, invalid chain with the "eclipsed" target node.  Then double spend the resource taken from the target node.  Then release the eclipse.
        - The target is the gossip protocol.
    - KERI resistence to Eclipse Attack
        - KERI's first seen rule.  Once key state is seen, it can't be unseen.
        - Reconciliation mechanisms to recover an AID if duplicity is seen.
        - To eclipse KERI you would have to attack the watcher network.
        - The verifier is always protected because of this rule.
        - The worst case in KERI of an Eclipse Attack is a denial of service.
    - Need for a published release and merge to main
        - We will publish a list of upcoming changes to be merged into main on Slack and give folks time to respond

    - Witnesses, Watchers and Blockchain
        - Indirect Replay Mode with Ledger Oracle diagram from Identifier Theory Paper
            - Validator looks up the backer (via ledger address) in the KEL of the AID which provides a cryptographic commitment to the ledger being the source of truth as a backer.
            - A rotation event would contain new ledger backer configuration information to change backers
            - A seal could be provided back as a receipt to the KEL event to include the hash address in the ledger.  This seal could be stored alongside the event to point to the place in the ledger.
            - When you have a ledger backer you don't have witnesses.
            - You can only have one ledger backer because you are relying on the total global ordering of the ledger.
            - Anything that verifies is technically also a watcher.  So a witness is also performing watcher services.
    - How to make any data authentic using KERI and friends -> Authentic Web
        - Authentic Web as a verifiable data structure built from signed hash chained content addressable data
        - Solves the hard problem of zero-trust architectures = signed-at-rest
            - signed in motion is relatively easy because can use ephemeral identifiers with ephemeral key state for tokens
            - key state at rest is hard because have to solve key rotation problem for persistent identifiers

- Items
    - Signify  (Signing at the Edge with keys at the edge)
        - Backgroud
            - Only a small set of activities that need to be protected in infrastructure for key management
                - key pair creation
                - key pair storage
                - event generating 
                - event signing
                - event verification
            - Trade off where these actions happen based on where you can secure / protect things.
            - Secure code supply chain for key pair creation and event signing.  Then storage is secured by encrypting where the keys are store
            - Signing is another level of security because you have to USE the private keys
            - What are the liabilities do a cloud host have to worry about.
                - Cloud host does not want to see keys (non-repudiation).  So we want to move event signing out of the cloud agent
                - Key state (next digest and current signing key) come from the client.
                - Cloud host ensures that the code supply chain is secure and never sees the private keys
            - Think of credential signing as yet another event generation and signing
            - We want to minimize what we program in the client.  Simplify the client to only the things we don't want in the cloud
                - key pair creation
                - event signing (the problem we want to avoid)
            - Key storage is stored encrypted on the client and can be backed up encrypted on the cloud so the cloud never sees the keys
            - Escrow - used it protocol design to handle out of order events.  Store the event and wait for the other stuff to show up and then continue processing of the event
            - Firebase approach of using SSE events to ping the client that a dataset has changed and needs attention.  Same approach used here to notify client that something needs to be signed or key pairs need to be created.  Those would be datasets that a client can check at anytime (start up, after loss of connection, after SSE event shows up).
            - Wallet - loaded term.  
            - Signify has nothing to attack at rest.  Encrypted secrets stored in the cloud.  A stateless wallet.
            - How does Signify trust that what she is signing is the correct thing.
                - Have to trust that the cloud provider has secured the agent code is running correctly
                - Cloud host could sign everything it sends to Signify


        -Signify is a web client event signing and key pair creation app that minimizes the use of KERI on the client. The web host cloud agent never sees any of the client's private keys in the clear, these are only unlocked in memory on the client only using the client's passcode which can be used to derive an asymmetric encryption/decryption key pair. The client creates key pairs and then sends them encrypted to the cloud agent that stores them encrypted. Whenever the client needs something signed, the cloud agent does the event generation in response to the client's commands and then sends the generated event back to the client along with the necessary encrypted private signing keys.  The client can then decrypt the private keys to sign and send back the signatures on the event. The client can then delete those private keys from memory. So Signify is key creation and event signing in the edge with key storage, event generation, and event verification in the cloud.  
Because event verification happens in the cloud it can use full KERI ACDCs etc and all signify clients can use full-featured web agents. The edge devices running the client only need to be able to create key pairs and sign events so they don't need to actually implement any KERI Core-specific functionality.  Although CESR would be nice to have. They don't do verification, they don't talk to witnesses or watchers, that is all done by the web-hosted cloud agent. This minimizes the liability of the cloud agent's web host provider because they never see private keys, and the client app is just a client app but with a back channel for decrypting and signing events generated on the agent and does key pair creation locally. It is not a wallet, The cloud agent is the cloud wallet but the private keys are only used in the edge.

We think this might be a good trade space for facilitating web clients that do not need to store anything and all the heavy lifting is done in the cloud.

Clearly, because event generation and verification are happening in the cloud an attacker who successfully attacks the cloud code supply chain can cause mischief by tricking the client into signing events that the client doesn't really want to sign. But that mischief never rises to the level of key compromise.

- Implementation
    - Leverage existing KERI Agent but add a Signify API
    - Change Manager of KeyStore to have a remote signing mode. Whenit gets signing requenst from cloud agent sends the request on back channel to Signify client to sign.
    - Make the controller signing look like witness signing
    - Escrow eventings waiting for them to collect enought signatures or receipts to meeting a threshold of acceptance.
    - Store and Forward cloud agent. Client does not have to keep state from session to session. All state is kept in the cloud. Use SSE (server sent events) to notify client that state has changed.
    - Stateless Wallet

                    - [Transferable](https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/transferable-identifier) vs [Non-transferable](https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/non-transferable-identifier) identifiers ([persistent](https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/persistent-identifier) vs ephemeral)
                - 2. Public Identfiers that are not cryptonomous.  DNS domain, social security number, etc.  (Non-cryptographically generated ID)
                - 3. Local Identifiers, Aliases.  Only have meaning to a local entity.  Not shared, avoids collisions.  
                    - Pet Names: Take local identifiers and share them with "friends".  Trying to solve Zooko's Triangle.
                        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle
                        - Can be solved with an identifier graph.  
                    - Problem with collisions.  
            - To solve the problems with #2 you have a trust domain.  You place each identifier in a trust domain resolved by the cryptonomous identifiers associated in the trust domain.  This avoids the need for a centralized registry or locus of control.  Because we solved the collision problem of namespacing.
            - Multi-factor association of loci of control.  For example, GLEIF will publish the root of trust to multiple public sources.  The set of these publication has loci of control which allows us to bootstrap the root of trust.
    - Classification of identifiers.  "Important identifiers" that hold credentials vs ephemeral identifiers used for short term communications.
        - If you can afford to discard the identifier, use non-transferable identifiers, for example witnesses.
        - If your identifier is going to have reputation that can't be discarded use transferable identifiers.

            - Moving into a "production mode" in infrastructure.
        - Recognition that this is will be a common problem for community
- Items
    -  Future of the Witness Network and Watcher Network
        -  What will it look like in the future?  
            -  Witnesses for "high stakes" identifiers will run on proprietary infrastructure
            -  Witness as a Service (WiaS).  Witness hosting that can be provisioned on demand
        -  What will the Watcher Network look like in the future?
            -  Community collaboration.
            -  Watcher as a Service (Waas?).
        -  Are these networks interconnected?
            -  There will be gossip protocol between Watchers.  Universally watches key state and detects duplicity and shares via gossip across the network.  Similar to the ceritficate transparency protocol used for SSL certs.  Will KERI it is either duplicity or not.  No guess work.
        -  Is it safe to assume that the Watcher network exists?
            -  Sam:  A verifier is a watcher.  Right now in the core, watchers are dumb.  If there is duplicity, it is simply discarded.  In the future, watchers will report on that duplicity and share both KERLs and duplicity across other Watchers.  
        -  Global vs Contextual Watcher networks?
            -  Varying layers of watcher networks...  Major companies, ecosystem and global watcher networks all sharing with each other.  
            -  The only attack on KERI is an eclipse attack so the larger your watcher network reach is the better your protection from this type of attack.  The only limitation is a resource constraint.  
            -  Where do the Judges run?  AT&T vs T-Mobile.  The only "fault" that is apparent is an attach on the KEL.  And that can only occur via key compromise.  So a successful multi-threshold attach causing duplicity is the only thing Watchers are looking for.  So even competitors will want to share across the entire ecosystem.  Similar to certificate transparency, all competitors in the internet hosting space share the information with each other because it is in their best interest to eliminate fraud / duplicity.
            -  Up to the ecosystems to cooporate on Watcher networks, controlled by the validators.
        -  Key compromise is very difficult, especially with multi-sig.  So there should be very few dupicitous occurances(sp?) across the KERI ecosystem.
        -  Pub-Sub push interface for current witness code plus running a witness in promiscuous(sp?) mode to make a watcher.
            -  Down the road, UDP gossip interface for witnesses and watchers sharing KELs
    -  Relationship between DIDComm and KERI/ACDC (Daniel Hardman)
        -  DIDComm and KERI have complimentary emphasis.
        -  Significant Overlaps across DIDComm and KERI
        -  Presentation from Daniel (proposal for how to "combine" the communities):
            -  https://bit.ly/3BeC9Wf
        -  Call for members of the KERI community to join DIDComm conversation and +1 calls for using CESR encoding in DIDComm
        -  DIDComm v2 just ratified in DIF and the conversation for v3 is now open.
            -  This is the time to start working towards unification.
            
    -  More CESR

        - Agenda items Henk:
          1. What is "Merging Habery PR"? Hab comes from 'Habitat'. It's a place where multi-sigs and AIDs are linked. _Habery_ manages a collection of Habs. A Hab is a datastructure (a Python object)
          The only hit (2022) in a Google search pointing to a github site 'habery _DOT_ github _DOT_ io' is NOT related.

            2. KERI / ACDC glossary alignment with ToIP concepts-terminology-wg [Example ACDC glossary](https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki) and eSSIF : [concepts terminologie](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary)

    - IETF-OOBI Draft  
        - https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-oobi
    - We currently issue as a controller the `/end/role/add` OOBI and send it to  Watcher. AFAIK there's no any real usage of this OOBI (yet?) from the Watcher perspective. Shall it be understood as an introduction to Watcher AUTH mechanism? In essence this OOBI becomes an introduction OOBI from the contorller perspective to Watcher. Watchers don't accept any request, but only those that are AUTHenticated first. Thanks to that Watchers support only these controllers that "registered" themselves. (added by Michal)
    - Escrow Maintenance Rules
        - When adding key events to various types of escrow's, how to ensure given escrow will not be fulfilled with some random events? Currently any type of key event that has proper semantics and where `d` field equals to `digest(event)` may be escrowed and stay there forever (because for example the signature is missing or `sn` doesn't match ). Possible solutions:
        - escrows have some kind of retention policy 
        - events in escrow have exp time
        - escrows have limited capacity

- How do you see DEL's (duplicitous event logs)?
  - How they're created/maintained?
  - Basic building blocks/what kind of messages it contains?
      - Duplicity notice message
  - Basic logic for detecting duplicity
      - monotonic logic for first seen accepted event. Once seen, always seen, never unseen. No revision possible. Detection logic upon receipt of two versions of an event at the same sn for a given AID = duplicity. Live vs Dead duplicity. Dead means one version already accepted to other is duplicitous version. Live when two version but neither has yet been accepted because not fully witnessed. Hold in escrow until one or neither is accepted. If neither then hold in escrow until a subsequent rotation designates which of the two is the valid one and so one.
      - Monotonic logic protects against continuous revision eclipse attack vulnerability such as is the case for PoW ledgers.


- Henk: **Education** - first draft of the [KERI MOOC](https://hackmd.io/nuUu5S8UQjOHXw_a53LvvA) now backupped on [github](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri-1/blob/main/docs/KERI-Mooc.md) and logged-in users can edit the hackmd file.\
What do you think is a good way to develop KERI knowledge, provoke adoption and develop more programming capacity?



- A **rubric-based eval of did:keri** - Daniel Hardman: go to https://w3c.github.io/did-rubric/ and answer all the questions about did:keri.\
Decision made Feb 8: we wait until the IETF draft for DID:KERI is finalized. Henk could contribute in draft and then propose his edits to team first.     
    
  
- **Terms and understanding**
***'SAD' and 'SAID'***, for Europeans the difference in pronunciation of SAD and SAID is hard to grasp and reproduce.
    The terms are closely related so we are not very alarmed that people confuse the terms.

- Witness dissemination protocol (how Witnesses promulgate receipts to Validator network) // added by Michal
    - Validator requests key state from its Watchers 
    - Watchers request key state from other trusted watchers
    - Watchers then request key state from published witnesses (after OOBI bootstrap)
    - Witnesses may support push interface such as SSE so that Watchers can subscribe to witness updates of keystate
    - CRitical role of watcher is monotonic view of Key state. First Seen Policy. First seen always seen never unseen.
        - Enables duplicity detection
        - Enables redundancy high availability
        - Reconcilable duplicity
    - Juror and Judge Deciders
    - Juror difference between watcher is that Juror reports duplicity whereas watcher just drops

- KERI incubation within IETF: work item under some WG / WG on its own...?
    - KERI presented to Blockchain WG; in the future perhaps hosted within this WG
    - We have to have a draft spec first. Then you form a (work item within a) working group to discuss the spec.
- Michal question: A lightweight protocol for streaming authentic data in  environments with unstable internet connection. Would CESR make sense?
    - Yes, we are able to create a UDP (asynchronous communication) version. It's easier to make UDP reliable than to make TCP scalable.
- GLEIF MultiSig demo KLI (command line version)
    - Two ways of reaching the threshold of a multisig by participant in a rotation event, is by sharing all public addresses among the group of possible signers. If you don't want to disclose pubic keys to other participants, then you could use digests of the public keys in a partial rotation event, where we only need the participating signers to reach the threshold; this subgroups needs to disclose their public keys.
